## NMR or ECFP4-based QSPR Machine Learning Input Generator

Demiurge is a modular and fully automated Python-based platform designed to generate machine learning input data from both simulated spectral and structural molecular representations. Specifically developed to support QSPR studies, it processes chemical structures provided as SMILES strings alongside target properties (e.g., CHI logD), and produces ready-to-use feature matrices for classical ML models and deep neural networks.

The tool supports four representation modes: predicted **¹H NMR** spectra, **¹³C NMR** spectra, concatenated **¹H | ¹³C** spectral vectors and **ECFP4** molecular fingerprints. Input files in `.csv` format are validated for SMILES integrity and formatting. Molecular structures are reconstructed using **RDKit** or **obabel**, optimized in 3D, then flattened to 2D to comply with NMR prediction tools.

NMR spectral predictions are performed locally using a standalone Java-based engine built on the **NMRshiftDB2** database, utilizing **HOSE-code** pattern matching. The resulting chemical shift lists are then transformed into fixed-length spectral vectors through a custom bucketing strategy (200 bins per nucleus, but can be changed in bucketing module script), enabling compatibility with ML pipelines. In the fused representation, the 1H and 13C vectors are joined together head to tail.

For ECFP4 generation, **RDKit's Morgan fingerprinting** (radius = 2) is used to construct 2048-bit binary descriptors. All generated feature matrices are merged with property labels (e.g., CHI logD), headers are appended, and the final datasets are saved as `.csv` files.

Demiurge is optimized for parallel execution on 8-core CPUs, achieving processing times of ~6 minutes for ¹H NMR spectra, ~15 minutes for ¹³C NMR, and under 2 minutes for ECFP4 on datasets of ~1000 molecules.

The architecture is fully extensible and easily adaptable to other endpoints such as **logP**, **TPSA**, or **logS**, and to other types of spectral or molecular representations.

The tool uses the NMRshiftDB2 predictor, which can be accessed [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/nmrshiftdb2/wiki/PredictorJars/).

## 🖥 Examples of Working Program

The script was run as an example for the prediction of 13C NMR spectra with an input file containing a misdefined one of the rows. In addition, a comma was inserted as the decimal separator and a semicolon was inserted as the column separator.

## ✅ Requirements

**Important**: The script was tested under **Windows 10** using **PowerShell** and works reliably in this environment on **Python 3.11.4**. It has **not** been tested on Linux or other operating systems.

Ensure the following software and libraries are installed:

1. **Python Libraries**:
   - `rdkit`
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `art`
   - `tqdm`

   Install the required Python packages using:

   ```bash
   pip install rdkit pandas numpy tqdm art
   ```
   or predefined Python script, which will check if the necessary libraries are installed. If not it will install them:

   ```bash
   python install_modules.py
   ```
2. **Open Babel**
   Open Babel is needed to process "exotic" structures that standard RDKit library can not process. Make sure the `obabel` command is available in your system's PATH.

3. **Java SDK**:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to compile and run the Java batch processor for NMR spectrum prediction. Make sure the `javac` and `java` commands are available in your system's PATH.

### ✅ Conda Environment

If you prefer to use Conda - utilize the provided environment file to create your Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
conda activate predictor_logD
```

Then Download & Install Java SDK (tested on version 23). Ensure java and javac are accessible in your PATH.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

1. **Java Compilation Issues**:
   - Ensure that the `javac` and `java` commands are available and the Java SDK is installed.
   - If `javac` is not recognized, check the system's `PATH` variable and make sure it includes the path to the JDK `bin` directory.

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all required Python libraries (`rdkit`, `pandas`, and `numpy`) are installed.

3. **File Not Found Errors**:
   - Verify the paths to input files and directories. Ensure that the input CSV file and other necessary files are correctly specified.

4. **Memory or Performance Issues**:
   - If handling a large dataset, consider increasing the memory allocation for the Java runtime by adjusting the `-Xmx` parameter in the script.
