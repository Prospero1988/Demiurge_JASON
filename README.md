## NMR (based on JEOL JASON software)  or ECFP4-based QSPR Machine Learning Input Generator

Demiurge is a modular and fully automated Python-based platform designed to generate machine learning input data from both simulated spectral and structural molecular representations. Specifically developed to support QSPR studies, it processes chemical structures provided as SMILES strings alongside target properties (e.g., CHI logD), and produces ready-to-use feature matrices for classical ML models and deep neural networks.

The tool supports four representation modes: predicted **¹H NMR** spectra, **¹³C NMR** spectra, concatenated **¹H | ¹³C** spectral vectors and **ECFP4** molecular fingerprints. Input files in `.csv` format are validated for SMILES integrity and formatting. Molecular structures are reconstructed using **RDKit** or **obabel**, optimized in 3D, then flattened to 2D to comply with NMR prediction tools.

NMR spectral predictions are performed locally with **JEOL JASON** (commercial, proprietary software by JEOL Ltd.), accessed programmatically via the `BeautifulJASON` Python API. The resulting chemical shift lists are then transformed into fixed-length spectral vectors through a custom bucketing strategy (200 bins per nucleus, but can be changed in bucketing module script), enabling compatibility with ML pipelines. In the fused representation, the 1H and 13C vectors are joined together head to tail.

For ECFP4 generation, **RDKit's Morgan fingerprinting** (radius = 2) is used to construct 2048-bit binary descriptors. All generated feature matrices are merged with property labels (e.g., CHI logD), headers are appended, and the final datasets are saved as `.csv` files.

The architecture is fully extensible and easily adaptable to other endpoints such as **logP**, **TPSA**, or **logS**, and to other types of spectral or molecular representations.


## 🖥 Examples of Working Program

The script was run as an example for the prediction of 13C NMR spectra with an input file containing a misdefined one of the rows. In addition, a comma was inserted as the decimal separator and a semicolon was inserted as the column separator.

### ⚙️ Script Workflow for NMR-based Output Data (1H / 13C)

1. **Step 1: Generate `.mol` Files**:
   - Reads SMILES codes from the input CSV file and generates corresponding `.mol` files using RDKit.

2. **Step 2: Predict NMR Spectra**  
   - Uses **JEOL JASON** (commercial, proprietary software by JEOL Ltd.) to predict NMR spectra for each molecule.  
   - Predictions are executed programmatically via the **BeautifulJASON** Python API, which communicates directly with the installed JASON application.  
   - The chemical-shift prediction engine built into JASON is used to generate ¹H or ¹³C spectra for subsequent processing.

3. **Step 3: Bucketize Spectra**:
   - Converts the predicted spectra into a uniform bucketized matrix for easy analysis and machine learning input generation.

4. **Step 4: Merge Spectra and Labels**:
   - Merges the bucketized spectra with the specified label column from the input CSV file.

5. **Step 5: Add Custom Headers**:
   - Adds descriptive headers to the final merged CSV file, making it easier to interpret and use for machine learning tasks.

6. **Step 6: Cleanup (Optional)**:
   - Deletes all intermediate files and directories if the `--clean` option is specified.
     

### ⚙️ Script Workflow for NMR-based Concatenated Output Data (1H|13C)

5. **Step 5: Add Custom Headers**:
   - Adds descriptive headers to the final merged CSV file, making it easier to interpret and use for machine learning tasks.
   - 
6. **Step 5: Concatenation od 1H adn 13C**:
   - The script connects 1H and 13C vectors head-to-tail. It combines representations for the same MOLECULE_NAME and for the same label value.

8. **Step 7: Cleanup (Optional)**:
   - Deletes all intermediate files and directories if the `--clean` option is specified.



### ⚙️ Script Workflow for ECFP4-based Output Data (FP)

1. **Step 1: Generate `.mol` Files**  
   - Reads SMILES strings from the input CSV file and converts them into 2D `.mol` files using RDKit.

2. **Step 2: Calculate ECFP4 Fingerprints**  
   - For each molecule, extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFP4) are generated from the `.mol` structures using the RDKit implementation.

3. **Step 3: Merge Fingerprints and Labels**  
   - Merges the computed ECFP4 vectors with the label column (e.g., logD values) from the input CSV file into a unified DataFrame.

4. **Step 4: Add Custom Headers**  
   - Assigns descriptive headers to the final CSV file, improving interpretability and downstream machine learning usability.

5. **Step 5: Cleanup (Optional)**  
   - Deletes all intermediate files and directories if the `--clean` flag is used.


## 🛠 Troubleshooting

1. **JEOL JASON Setup Issues**
   - Ensure **JEOL JASON** is installed, activated, and licensed.  
     Launch the application once to complete activation.
   - Install the Python binding (**BeautifulJASON**) in the same environment as your code:
     ```bash
     pip install beautifuljason
     ```
   - Verify that BeautifulJASON can locate the JASON application:
     ```bash
     jason_config --display
     ```
     If the application is not detected, set the path explicitly:
     ```bash
     # Windows
     jason_config --set-app "C:\Program Files\JEOL\JASON\JASON.exe"
     # macOS
     jason_config --set-app "/Applications/JASON.app"
     # Linux (if applicable in your setup)
     jason_config --set-app "/opt/JASON/JASON"
     ```
   - Load all plugins when creating a session (missing plugins can lead to empty `Molecules` groups):
     ```python
     import beautifuljason as bjason
     j = bjason.JASON(plugins=None)  # load all plugins
     ```
   - Smoke test: confirm a `.mol` is actually imported
     ```python
     import os
     import beautifuljason as bjason

     test_mol = "example.mol"  # replace with a real, small MOL file
     j = bjason.JASON(plugins=None)
     with j.create_document(os.path.abspath(test_mol), rules="off") as doc:
         mols = list(doc.mol_data)
         assert mols, "No molecules imported—check plugins, path, license, or the MOL file integrity."
         print(f"OK: imported {len(mols)} molecule(s).")
     ```
   - Common errors & fixes:
     - `object 'Molecules' doesn't exist` or `doc.mol_data` is empty → use `plugins=None`, verify the file path and format (`.mol`/`.sdf`), ensure JASON is activated/licensed, try an SDF export if needed.
     - “Application not found” → run `jason_config --set-app ...` and re-check with `jason_config --display`.
     - Headless/remote environments → JASON must be installed locally; GUI/desktop availability may be required depending on your OS and license model.

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all required Python libraries (`rdkit`, `pandas`, and `numpy`) are installed.

3. **File Not Found Errors**:
   - Verify the paths to input files and directories. Ensure that the input CSV file and other necessary files are correctly specified.

4. **Memory or Performance Issues**:
   - If handling a large dataset, consider increasing the memory allocation for the Java runtime by adjusting the `-Xmx` parameter in the script.
